I started investing when I was 13. I traded and invested in stocks and cryptocurrencies. I’ve made money and I’ve lost money. But both taught me how to be a better investor. 

Whenever I have a few cents, I always invest it all. 1) I’m young, hence I can afford a greater risk because I don’t have obligations and/or could afford to lose (I don’t like it though) 2) It makes no sense to have the money in the bank (you lose every day because of inflation).

How can you invest with $0?

There is one way to use your parent’s money (not what you’re thinking) and your money by using automated investing apps. For instance, Acorns lets you automatically invest spare change by rounding up the purchases you make with a credit or debit card. 

Personally, I don’t have that many transactions so it wouldn’t be as effective. I found a better way:

1. Talk to your parents and convince them to let you use their information (i.e. SSN)

    1. Explain to them focusing on the advantages and benefits to them and to you such as learning how to invest, becoming more independent, or saving up for a cause. 

2. Set up an automated investing account (i.e. Acorns, Stash, SoFi, etc)

3. Convince your parents to let you round up their debit and credit transactions.

4. That’s it! You’re done and investing.

I love investing because I make money. Investing is a way to grow and multiply your money. I’d suggest you start today using my Acorns [invite link](https://acorns.com/invite/23TGKN), and you’ll get $5 to invest. You can [sign up here](https://acorns.com/invite/23TGKN). 

People like to get fancy, but investing does not need to be complex, it can be easy and automated. And sometimes without using your own money.
