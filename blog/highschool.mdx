Graduating high school is one of those moments you look forward to as a kid. When you get to 9th grade, you’re not as excited. When you get to 12th grade, you just want to get the hell out of that place. 

How are we letting this happen?

We’re losing our kids and damaging the future of future generations. High school is the most important period of a person’s life because that is when you built the foundation. Yet, we’re using wet sand, instead of hard solid rocks to build the future we all want. 

 This is my experience after going through high school. A four-year journey with ups and downs, but with many lessons to learn. 

Before we walk into the classroom, let me show you where the seats (topics) will be:

* Freshman Year - Learning English in One Day

* Sophomore Year - Scaling UP

* Junior Year - Creating the Next Generations of Doers & Dreamers

* Senior Year - A New Beginning

* Final Remarks

### Freshman Year - Learning English in One Day

I was born and raised in Venezuela. I lived there for almost 14 years. We were threatened, and [our days were numbered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_ypK3r24og). We moved to the U.S. out of desperation to start our lives over again: with no connections, no English, and nothing familiar.  We went from living a life with luxuries to living a frugal life, yet we were determined to keep living.


I was enrolled in high school. The first day of high school began on a sunny summer day in August. The feeling was overwhelming. I got outside and waited for the school bus to pick me up. The bus later arrived at this massive high school that seemed more like a college, with over 2,500 people.  Somehow, I found my first-period class. A new journey was about to begin, a journey that made me who I am today. 

My first goal was to learn English in ONE day. What do you think happened? Yes? No? Well, I wasn’t even close. The only thing I had was a bunch of headaches. I didn’t care and tried again. This time the goal was learning in a week. No way! I tried again, one month. I had learned some words, and phrases, but nothing close to fluency. Yet, I tried again, six months. 

Watch me say my first words in English:

After long hours of dedication, hard work, courage, asking questions, and being vulnerable enough to talk to people even though they might not understand or might laugh at me, I achieved my goal. 

I learned English in six months. 

How did I make this happen?

Some people think it’s just because of my age, but very few kids or adults learn the language in 6 months. I wanted to accomplish this goal and was very strategic about how to make it happen. I did three things.

1. Took entertaining online courses 

    1. I took an MBA course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/an-entire-mba-in-1-courseaward-winning-business-school-prof/) by Chris Haroun - Chris is awesome. He even endorsed my book.

    2. I took a bunch of courses on edX.org about economic progress, technology, and Excel.

2. I didn’t understand 90% of the words. I didn’t care. I would pause the video and look up the words.

3. Magazine Subscriptions

    1. I bought a $10 National Geographic & Forbes magazine subscription.

        1. Again, I didn’t understand more than 90%. I had a sheet of paper next to me to write down the words I didn’t know (all of them). After I finished reading, I would then look up every single word.

1. Yo No Hablar Español

    1. This sounds obvious, but few people do it. I forgot I knew Spanish. The information I consumed was **only in English** including social media, email, movies, audio, etc. 


Was there any reason I decided to learn English in such a short amount of time?

I always set crazy goals that I know I may not achieve, but at least I try. Here, it didn’t happen in one day, but in six months. 

I wanted to get to the same level as most of my peers. I was ready for more challenges. I enrolled in college-level and honors classes. The following year, I took college level and honors courses. I was doing everything you were supposed to. What everyone told me to do, learn English, study, and get good grades. I went a step beyond, I even joined several clubs and played soccer and ran track.

### Curiosity is Everything

I had other interests and knew that grades alone were meaningless because if that were true all the valedictorians would be rich and happy, which is not the case. Grades are somewhat important, but following your curiosity is what makes a person unique. Following my curiosity makes me happy. 

My desire to learn and curiosity was everything for me. I started companies, learned to invest, became a learner and doer. I started to see these opportunities and challenges to overcome. It seemed like a video game. 

Was I always like this? No, I wasn’t. I was normal. Everything changed when I took responsibility. Adversity and necessity forced me to rely on myself, so I stopped being a “normal” kid, and took full responsibility for my life. When you move to a new country and start from zero, you can use all the disadvantages to your benefit. You can complain, or you can do something. 

I decided to do something. 

I noticed the endless opportunities to do and learn what I was curious about. I just needed to put in the work. Then, there are concepts such as [leverage](https://www.juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/leverage) that give me excitement like nothing else. We have the opportunity to leverage today’s technology such as the internet to create breathtaking projects by doing things we care about. Just by focusing on the internet, the opportunities are limitless. 

The first company I started was a digital marketing agency a few months after I arrived in Chicago. I noticed that small businesses in my area were not taking advantage of social media and marketing. What did I do? I taught myself about social media marketing and started finding clients by going door-to-door, talking with people, asking current clients, and even family friends. I had challenges; I realized people don’t really trust 13/14 years-olds, so I learned to talk and present well. I didn’t know everything, but I just needed to get started. 

After I started this company, I had some profits. As a teenager, I didn’t have expenses, so my earnings were pure profit. 

I bought a yearly $10 Forbes subscription because I wanted to learn from the most successful people. Ironically, your teenage years are the best time to start [investing](http://juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/teeninvesting) because you can afford to lose (I don’t like it though), yet few teens do it. I invested in companies and even cryptocurrencies with the money from my marketing company.

I started reading and learning more about the way things work in the U.S. and in English. Most of the world’s knowledge is only in English. Once I tapped into it, my brain neurological pathways changed radically. Opportunities appeared everywhere, and I became a doer. 

In the summer of freshman year, I wanted to reach the same academic level of my peers, so I took a math class (geometry) over the summer. It seemed like a smart decision, but in reality it wasn’t as smart because I could’ve spent that time working on an interesting project or learning more about a topic I was interested in. I don’t know everything. 

### Sophomore Year - Scaling UP

By the time I became a sophomore. I enrolled in AP (college classes) and honors courses. I joined more clubs such as the Debate Club, Business club, Biology, among others. I also played soccer and track & field. 

After a year, my English had vastly improved and I was doing well both academically and in business. I enrolled in these “hard classes,” and I was doing well, getting a 4.0 GPA by the end of the year. Meanwhile, my marketing company continued growing, and I continued to learn about investing. 

I would wake up at 4:00 am, read a book for an hour, research and find a stock to trade during the day, and get ready for school. I would start trading during P.E (Physical Education) or health classes. I was crushing it and was having a ton of fun. 

In the summer of sophomore year, I applied to one of the most prestigious entrepreneurial summer programs for high school students called LaunchX at UPenn. It was that program where you meet the next “Bill Gates” or “Elon Musk.” Everyone was super talented and had started companies and nonprofits before the program. It was an awesome experience. I stayed for four weeks. 

The goal was to create a startup within 4 weeks with a group of people. Our startup didn’t last, but at the end of the program, I was awarded the most awards ever in the program’s history. These awards include “Best Speaker,” “Most Confident,” “Most Likely To Be Millionaire,” among others. It was a great time and I will always remember the friends I met and the experience I had.

After I got back from Philadelphia, I went to a Chicago entrepreneurship center called 1871. A startup incubator called Techstars had a program there, and I asked if any of the startups were looking for interns. I was willing to work for free. I didn’t care about the money because I wanted to learn. I worked at a drone start-up and an A.I. fitness trainer. I would go with the founders to their mentors’ meetings to take notes or help with whatever they needed to do. I couldn’t be happier learning from investors, venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and overall successful people. 

School was becoming too easy, so for an academic challenge. I decided to transfer to a harder school for junior year. Every decision has its consequences, and this was no exception.

I continued taking honors and college-level classes, but something more opportunities showed up. “Once-In-A-Lifetime Opportunities” that I couldn’t say “no” to.

When I make decisions, I use this framework, I learned from the author and options trader Nassim Taleb. **The quality of my decisions is not measured by the outcome, rather by what the other possible outcome could have been**. He says, “One cannot judge a performance in any given field (war, politics, medicine, investments) by the results, but by the costs of the alternative (i.e, if history played out in a different way).”

Here, the possible outcome or even the worst possible outcome was calculated.  You’ll see why. 

I didn’t know anyone, I didn’t know this or that, but I’ve learned to like challenges so much that now I enjoy and pursue them. As 11th grade began, so did the opportunities. I played soccer in the fall and joined a bunch of clubs (at least one every day). For me, that was the way to explore and truly know what I like and what I don’t like. 

I found a program at the largest museum in the western hemisphere: the Museum of Science & Industry. It was a 5-month program.

The museum was about two hours from the suburb where I live. I woke up at 5 am, took two trains, walked, and did whatever I needed to do to get there. Sometimes I had to walk in temperatures under 10 F° or sometimes I forgot the money to pay for the train (quite an experience convincing conductors to let me in for free). 

If learning more about science, technology, and engineering meant waking up before dawn, walking in the snow. I was more than willing to do it. 

I want to keep being an entrepreneur. I had learned the business side such as marketing, persuasion, and selling. I wanted to learn more about the [science](https://www.juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/carlo-rovelli-the-poetic-physicist)/engineering side such as building, designing, and researching. 

This museum program ended in December 2018. I wanted to keep learning about science. The opportunities for great businesses and innovation would be unimaginable.

So I signed up for the Saturday morning program at Fermilab, America's particle physics and accelerator laboratory. The program was utterly fascinating. The way it worked was that we had two hours of lecture and an hour to tour the facilities. We had researchers who talked about quantum mechanics, neutrinos, dark matter, dark energy, high-energy particle physics, among others. Then, we would go to where scientists were working on the latest supercomputers, the particle physics tunnels, and even bison. This program was one of the most rewarding science experiences I’ve ever had.
