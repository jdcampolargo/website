    <h1>Weekly Planning Sheet</h1>
    <p> If I’ve ever done anything “productive” in my life is due to what I call the “Weekly Planning Sheet” where I set my priorities and goals in an hourly manner.

This allows me to do, and not think about what I’m going to do. 

Many people are unproductive because they spend thinking about what they’re going to do, instead of doing. 

This also helps with procrastination. </p>
